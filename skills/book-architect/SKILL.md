# Book Architect

Transform a validated niche into a complete book blueprint: reader pain points, 10 title options, 10 subtitle options, and a detailed 8-chapter outline with 3 subchapters and 3 sections each. Based on Sean Dollwet's ChatGPT drafting pipeline from Chapter 4.

## Usage

```
/book-architect --niche "beekeeping for beginners" --keyword "beekeeping for beginners"
/book-architect --niche "anxiety management" --keywords "anxiety relief" "stress management" "calm mind"
```

## Prerequisites

- Niche validated via `/niche-scout`
- Primary keyword identified via `/keyword-fill` or niche research
- Target audience understood

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Reader Pain Point Discovery

Start by understanding the reader, not by writing.

> "Instead of saying straight up, hey, write me a book on mental toughness, you have to first identify the pain points so that we can write a book around that."
> -- Sean Dollwet, "How to Create an eBook FAST with ChatGPT (Step-By-Step)"

**Prompt to use:**

```
I'm writing a book about [NICHE/TOPIC]. Please help me list the biggest pain points
of the reader that needs to be solved. Tell me what they feel and think and what they want.
```

**Review the output critically:**
- Are these real problems readers face, or generic filler?
- Cross-reference against negative reviews of competitor books (what do readers complain about?)
- Add pain points from your own knowledge/experience
- Rank pain points by severity and frequency

**Output:** A ranked list of 8-12 reader pain points that the book will solve.

### Phase 2: Title Generation (10 Options)

Generate title ideas that incorporate the primary keyword AND address the pain points from Phase 1.

**Prompt:**

```
Based on these reader pain points: [PASTE PAIN POINTS]

Generate 10 short title ideas for a book about [TOPIC].
The title should incorporate the keyword "[PRIMARY KEYWORD]".
Keep titles simple and instantly clear.
```

**Title rules from Sean Dollwet:**

> "If people have to stop and read the title, read the book cover, and take a couple seconds just to understand what the book is about, then that is a failed book cover. You want people to know instantly, without even thinking, without even observing carefully, what the book is about in a split second."
> -- Sean Dollwet, "Amazon KDP MISTAKES"

> "Just call it 'Robots Fighting Dinosaurs Coloring Book.' You don't have to do this whole 'first high quality cool premium coloring book.'"
> -- Sean Dollwet, "Amazon KDP MISTAKES"

**Output:** 10 title options ranked by clarity and keyword integration.

### Phase 3: Subtitle Generation (10 Options)

The subtitle carries the SEO weight. Your main keyword belongs here if it's not already in the title.

**Prompt:**

```
Please give me 10 long subtitle ideas about [CHOSEN TITLE].
It should clearly describe the benefits of reading the book.
Use power words and numbers to make it attractive.
Add the keyword "[TARGET KEYWORD]" to it.
```

**Subtitle rules:**

> "Explain what the book is in the subtitle... it could be as simple as 'sci-fi superhero thriller' or 'sci-fi superhero adventure for kids.'"
> -- Sean Dollwet, "Amazon KDP MISTAKES"

For nonfiction, frame the benefit with a concrete promise. Sean rewrites a meditation subtitle from "The Simple Guide to Mindfulness and Improved Mental Health" to: "A simple guide to discover inner peace, develop mindfulness, and improve mental health in 30 days or less."

**Avoid health claims:** Words like "heal" or "cure" will block Amazon Ads. Use "improve," "discover," or "support" instead.

**Output:** 10 subtitle options ranked by benefit clarity and keyword integration.

### Phase 4: Detailed Book Outline

This is the structural backbone. Generate a full outline with specific constraints.

**Prompt:**

```
Create a detailed 8 chapter book outline with three subchapters
that have three sections for a book on [TOPIC].
The title is [CHOSEN TITLE]. The subtitle is [CHOSEN SUBTITLE].

Additional requirements:
- Avoid repeating the same information throughout the book
- Start each chapter with a hook -- relevant quote, interesting facts, statistics
- Focus on novel ideas rather than basic information
- Focus on actionable steps rather than just facts
- Break each chapter into 3 sub-chapters
- Expand each subchapter with 3 bullet points
- Use markdown formatting
```

**Outline validation checklist:**
- [ ] Does every chapter solve a real pain point from Phase 1?
- [ ] Is there progression (beginner concepts first, advanced later)?
- [ ] No repeated information across chapters?
- [ ] Each chapter has actionable takeaways, not just information?
- [ ] Chapter hooks are specific and engaging?
- [ ] Total structure supports ~30,000 words (3,750 words/chapter)?

### Phase 5: Word Count Planning

Target specifications from Sean Dollwet:

| Level | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Total manuscript | ~30,000 words (120-150 pages) |
| Per chapter | 30,000 / 8 = ~3,750 words |
| Per subchapter | 3,750 / 3 = ~1,250 words |

This structure directly feeds the `/manuscript-drafter` skill, which generates content one 1,250-word section at a time.
